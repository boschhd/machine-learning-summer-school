    "After having the chance to try different parameters in the Tensorflow Playground, now it's our turn to implement something by ourselves using neural networks. As you may remember we already worked with the Fashion-MNIST dataset using unsupervised methods. Today we're going to use Keras in order to build our model, this time supervised classification. Keras is a high level framework for machine learning, which uses Tensorflow as backend. It allows us to implement neural network in a very confortable form. For more information about Keras go to <https://keras.io/>\n",

Test data is useful to observe that our model is not only memorizing the samples, but it should be able to classify unseen data. Therefore, we don't provide the model with labels in the test phase."
